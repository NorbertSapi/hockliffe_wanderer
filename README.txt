Hockliffe Wanderer

The main goal of this project is to create a website for an imanigary local walking group / organisation. The idea of the group came from a group of women from Hockliffe who started to meet to walk together first and meet in the local pub once in month. I use fictive pictures for the website. 

Programming language used: HTML5, CSS3

I have used responsive design to make a modern website. There are 4 main options in the navigation bar. Under Activities There are further 3 more option to choose from. I have left an error in the "Walking section". One of the pictures does not load, therefore the label of the image is visible. 

I have implemented a "Home Button", which I am planning to use in the future projects. The home button is fixed to the right handsite of the page.

I have added the logos of the different contact - facebook, instagramm, email, location - to the botom of the site. IMPORTANT: this contacts are not working, they are only linked to the same spot of this site.

Footer: I have added the Creators name, creators contact email.  

Contact Page: I have added a simple contact page, where you can add your name and your message before you send it to the group.


I HOPE YOU LIKE MAY PROJECT!
